# **Medical Calculator Verification & Validation Report**

**Date:** 2025-12-16  
**Protocol:** Medical Calculator Verification & Validation Protocol (SaMD Framework)  
**Status:** Phase 2 (Technical Verification) Complete for Selected Calculators

## **1. Executive Summary**

This report documents the verification status of three key medical calculators within the MedCalcEHR system. Following the **SaMD Framework**, we have successfully deconstructed the physiological logic (Phase 1) and performed rigorous technical verification using the "Golden Dataset" strategy (Phase 2). All tested calculators achieved **100% pass rates** against synthetic reference datasets.

## **2. Methodology**

### **Phase 1: Physiological Deconstruction**
For each calculator, the core logic was extracted from the UI-bound code into a pure, testable function (`calculation.js`). This ensures separation of concerns and facilitates automated testing.

### **Phase 2: Technical Verification (The "Golden Dataset")**
*   **Strategy:** Parallel Testing.
*   **Reference:** A Python script (`verify.py`) implemented the "Ground Truth" formulas to generate a CSV dataset with `N=~100` cases, covering normal, pathological, and edge-case values.
*   **Verification:** A Node.js script (`run_verification.js`) executed the JavaScript implementation against this dataset, asserting precision to `±0.0001` (or relevant tolerance).

### **Phase 4: Risk Management (Implemented Mitigations)**
Analysis of code reveals implementation of mitigations for common failure modes identified in the protocol.

## **4. Detail: Risk Assessment & Control (Example: NAFLD)**

*Reference: SaMD Protocol Phase 4 (FMEA)*

| Failure Mode | Severity | Mitigation Strategy in Code | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Logic Error** | Critical | **Decoupled Logic:** The calculation logic is isolated in `calculation.js` preventing UI code from interfering with math. | ✅ Implemented |
| **Unit Mismatch** | High | **UnitConverter:** The verified implementation uses `UnitConverter.getStandardValue()` to ensure inputs (e.g., Albumin) are in correct units before math. | ✅ Implemented |
| **Invalid Input** | Moderate | **ValidationRules:** Inputs like BMI and Age are validated against physiological ranges before execution. | ✅ Implemented |

## **5. Next Steps**

1.  **Expand Verification:** Apply this Protocol to the remaining calculators in the library (e.g., `2helps2b`, `pecarn`, etc.).
2.  **Clinical Validation (Phase 3):** Review diagnostic accuracy metrics (AUC, Sensitivity) from primary literature for each calculator and append to their documentation/info-box.
3.  **Documentation (Phase 5):** Finalize TRIPOD-style reporting for the entire suite.
