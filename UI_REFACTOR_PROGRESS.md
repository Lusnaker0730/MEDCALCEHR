# UI Builder Refactoring Progress

I have continued the refactoring process and successfully updated the following calculators to use the `UIBuilder` and `UnitConverter`:

1.  **APACHE II (`apache-ii`)**:
    *   Complex multi-section form refactored using `createSection`, `createInput`, and `createRadioGroup`.
    *   Integrated `UnitConverter` for temperature, MAP, etc.
    *   Used `createResultBox` for standardized scoring results.

2.  **Child-Pugh Score (`child-pugh`)**:
    *   Refactored scoring criteria using `createRadioGroup`.
    *   Standardized the result display with prognosis information using `createResultItem`.

3.  **Calcium Correction (`calcium-correction`)**:
    *   Refactored simple inputs with unit toggles.
    *   Added a standardized `createFormulaSection` for transparency.

## UIBuilder Enhancements
To support these refactors, I added the following methods to `js/ui-builder.js`:
*   `createResultBox({ id, title })`: Creates a hidden-by-default result container with a standard header.
*   `createResultItem({ label, value, unit, interpretation, alertClass })`: Generates a formatted result row.
*   `createAlert({ type, message, icon })`: Generates standard alert boxes (info, warning, danger).
*   `createFormulaSection({ items })`: Generates a clean formula display section.

## Benefits Realized
*   **Code Reduction**: The `generateHTML` methods are significantly shorter and more readable.
*   **Standardization**: All calculators now share the exact same visual language for inputs, results, and alerts.
*   **Maintainability**: Updates to result styling or alert designs will now propagate to all refactored calculators instantly.

## Next Steps
*   Continue identifying high-value calculators for refactoring (e.g., `sofa`, `meld-na`).
*   Consider adding a `createTable` method to `UIBuilder` for calculators that need tabular data display.
