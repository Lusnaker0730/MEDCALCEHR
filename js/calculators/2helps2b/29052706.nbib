AB  - IMPORTANCE: Continuous electroencephalography (EEG) use in critically ill 
      patients is expanding. There is no validated method to combine risk factors and 
      guide clinicians in assessing seizure risk. OBJECTIVE: To use seizure risk 
      factors from EEG and clinical history to create a simple scoring system 
      associated with the probability of seizures in patients with acute illness. 
      DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We used a prospective multicenter (Emory 
      University Hospital, Brigham and Women's Hospital, and Yale University Hospital) 
      database containing clinical and electrographic variables on 5427 continuous EEG 
      sessions from eligible patients if they had continuous EEG for clinical 
      indications, excluding epilepsy monitoring unit admissions. We created a scoring 
      system model to estimate seizure risk in acutely ill patients undergoing 
      continuous EEG. The model was built using a new machine learning method 
      (RiskSLIM) that is designed to produce accurate, risk-calibrated scoring systems 
      with a limited number of variables and small integer weights. We validated the 
      accuracy and risk calibration of our model using cross-validation and compared 
      its performance with models built with state-of-the-art logistic regression 
      methods. The database was developed by the Critical Care EEG Research Consortium 
      and used data collected over 3 years. The EEG variables were interpreted using 
      standardized terminology by certified reviewers. EXPOSURES: All patients had more 
      than 6 hours of uninterrupted EEG recordings. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The 
      main outcome was the average risk calibration error. RESULTS: There were 5427 
      continuous EEGs performed on 4772 participants (2868 men, 49.9%; median age, 61 
      years) performed at 3 institutions, without further demographic stratification. 
      Our final model, 2HELPS2B, had an area under the curve of 0.819 and average 
      calibration error of 2.7% (95% CI, 2.0%-3.6%). It included 6 variables with the 
      following point assignments: (1) brief (ictal) rhythmic discharges (B[I]RDs) (2 
      points); (2) presence of lateralized periodic discharges, lateralized rhythmic 
      delta activity, or bilateral independent periodic discharges (1 point); (3) prior 
      seizure (1 point); (4) sporadic epileptiform discharges (1 point); (5) frequency 
      greater than 2.0 Hz for any periodic or rhythmic pattern (1 point); and (6) 
      presence of "plus" features (superimposed, rhythmic, sharp, or fast activity) (1 
      point). The probable seizure risk of each score was 5% for a score of 0, 12% for 
      a score of 1, 27% for a score of 2, 50% for a score of 3, 73% for a score of 4, 
      88% for a score of 5, and greater than 95% for a score of 6 or 7. CONCLUSIONS AND 
      RELEVANCE: The 2HELPS2B model is a quick accurate tool to aid clinical judgment 
      of the risk of seizures in critically ill patients.
